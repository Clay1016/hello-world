# hello-world

Hey everyone!

I've been primarily focused on finance and financial news for over 15 years. 
I'm looking to use statistics, computer science and pything to use data to help tell a story, making things faster
and find anomolies for stories. I've got a long way to go, so this is just the beginning.
